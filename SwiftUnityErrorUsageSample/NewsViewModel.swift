    var unityErrorOccured: ((UnityError) -> Void)!
    // This is an utmostly common usage case
    // in which the UnityError represents
    // an error that has occured while working
    // with whichever service under whichever conditions.
    // This is the most generic interface which is called
    // on a whole bunch of common shit.
    // What will be going on in the view layer, is that
    // an emission will be produced and mapped to GUI.
    // Note: here, a view is supposed to fiddle with all
    // UnityError objects in the same generic way.
    
    var networkingErrorOccured: ((UnityError) -> Void)!
    // This, however, is unique and used for cases requiring
    // special treatment
    // Despite being totally explicit about
    // the actual error's contents semantics,
    // this unit of GUI error propagation
    // just propagates the error object,
    // preferably already casted to UnityError,
    // to the view layer.
    // Note: GUI emitter IS NOT INVOKED HERE.
    // Why tho? Because WE ARE NOT THE VIEW,
    // WE ISN'T INTERESTED IN THIS GARBAGE
